The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details. 
This dataset is a small dataset which includes 8 key features & a binary target value as follows:

Number of times pregnant
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes pedigree function
Age (years)
Class variable (0 or 1)
A small logistic regression model will be developed in an attempt to predict whether a patient is likely (represented by 1) or not likely 
(represented by 0) to develop diabetes in the next 5 years.
